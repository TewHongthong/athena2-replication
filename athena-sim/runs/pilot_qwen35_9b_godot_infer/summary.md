## No-oracle diagnostics

The identifier kind in these prompts was inferred from the code, not read from the benchmark. `kind matches` compares the inferred kind with the benchmark's kind (grading only); scope verdicts are those of `check_rename` for the model's suggestion (an unchanged name is not checked).

| condition | trials | kind matches | kind unknown | kind outside pack | scope-checked | scope ok | scope conflict | unchecked |
